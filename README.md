# TuffyNotes Project

# # Project specifications
The goal of this project is to develop a note-taking application. Users will use a menu-based command-line interface to interact with the software. Its major features are the creation of notes, adding notes to a notebook, and saving and loading notes into text files. 

The software should be designed using the object-oriented programming paradigm so that the code can easily be modified, extended, and scaled by other developers. It is equally important to provide sufficient internal documentation to help other developers understand the code and encourage them to contribute to its development.
